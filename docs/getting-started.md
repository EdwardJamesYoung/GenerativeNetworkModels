# Generative Network Model Toolbox - Getting Started

## Installing Package

### 1. Obtaining a local copy of the package
1. Clone the git repository or download from [GitHub](https://github.com/EdwardJamesYoung/GenerativeNetworkModels.git)
    - You can do this either via git:
        - In the command line:
            1. If you haven't already installed git, you can do so via [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/)
            2. `cd ./directory/to/install/into`
            3. `git clone https://github.com/EdwardJamesYoung/GenerativeNetworkModels.git`
    - Or download directly from GitHub (Not Recommended):
        1. Download from the same page as a .zip file
        2. Extract the contents of the file into a chosen directory

### 2. Installing into a project
1. If installing into a virtual environment (.venv) or a conda environment (.conda), ensure these are active. Assuming you have already created the environment:
    - Activate a virtual environment using:
        - `.venv/Scripts/activate`
    - Activate a conda environment using:
        - `conda activate name-of-environment`
2. Run `pip install ./directory/to/install/into` in the command line

Done!
